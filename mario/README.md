# ðŸ§± Mario

## Overview
C program that prints a **double half-pyramid** of a given height, inspired by Super Mario Bros.. The pyramid has two sides with a gap in the middle
 
## How It Works

- Prompts the user to input a height between 1 and 8 (inclusive)
- Uses nested loops to print:
  - Left-aligned spaces
  - Left half of the pyramid (#)
  - A fixed gap of two spaces
  - Right half of the pyramid (#)
