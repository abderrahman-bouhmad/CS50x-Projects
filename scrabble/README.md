# ðŸŽ¯ Scrabble

## Overview
A simple C program that simulates a mini Scrabble game where two players enter words and the program determines the winner based on the score of each word.

## How It Works

- Prompts both players to enter a word.
- Scores each word by summing the point values of its letters (A=1, B=3, ..., Z=10).
- Declares the winner based on which player has a higher total score â€” or announces a tie if scores are equal.
