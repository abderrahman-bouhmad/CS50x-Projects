# üñºÔ∏è Filters

## Overview
A C program that applies simple image filters (grayscale, sepia, reflect, blur) to a BMP file. Focuses on understanding how digital images are represented as pixel arrays and how to manipulate pixel values.

## How It Works

- Loads a BMP file into memory
- Applies the selected filter to each pixel:
  - Grayscale: Averages the RGB values
  - Sepia: Adjusts colors using a weighted formula
  - Reflect: Flips image horizontally
  - Blur: Averages RGB values of neighboring pixels
- Saves the updated image as a new BMP file
