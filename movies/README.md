## üåê Technologies Used

- SQLite

## üìú Database Schema
Here‚Äôs the schema of the `movies.db` database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE directors (
    movie_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    person_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY(movie_id) REFERENCES movies(id),
    FOREIGN KEY(person_id) REFERENCES people(id)
);
CREATE TABLE movies (
    id INTEGER,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    year NUMERIC,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
CREATE TABLE people (
    id INTEGER,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    birth NUMERIC,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
CREATE TABLE ratings (
    movie_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    rating REAL NOT NULL,
    votes INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY(movie_id) REFERENCES movies(id)
);
CREATE TABLE stars (
    movie_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    person_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY(movie_id) REFERENCES movies(id),
    FOREIGN KEY(person_id) REFERENCES people(id)
);
