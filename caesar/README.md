# 🛡️ Caesar Cipher

## Overview
A simple encryption program that implements Caesar's Cipher in C, allowing users to encode messages by rotating letters a fixed number of places.

## 🔐 What It Does

- Accepts a single command-line argument: a non-negative integer key
- Prompts the user for plaintext
- Returns the ciphertext by rotating each alphabetical character by the key using ASCII math:
    - Keeps uppercase/lowercase letters intact
    - Leaves non-alphabetical characters unchanged

## Technologies

- C (with the CS50 library)
