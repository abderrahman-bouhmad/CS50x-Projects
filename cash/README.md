# ðŸ’° Cash

## Overview
A C program that calculates **the minimum number of coins** needed to make change for a given amount of cents, using a **greedy algorithm**. The program repeatedly prompts the user for valid input and then determines how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are needed.

## How It Works

- On program start:
  - Prompts the user for the amount of change owed (must be an integer â‰¥ 0)
  - Uses a greedy algorithm to:
    - Subtract as many quarters as possible
    - Then dimes, nickels, and pennies
  - Sums and prints the total number of coins used
